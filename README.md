# tBTC Contract Watcher

This website was created as part of the Playing for Keeps event promoted by Keep Network. It provides the current state of 'ongoing' contracts minted on tBTC Network, it means the following states: Active, Awaiting Withdrawal, Awaiting Withdrawal Proof and Courtesy Call.

Here you'll find information such as 'collateralization % of a contract' and 'time left to take action on a contract'. We're also providing a GET API Endpoint so you can create your own application on top this infrastructure.

I would like to thank Matt Luongo and the entire Keep Team for providing such an active and thriving community, this project will certainly be great.

We are only at the beginning of this journey.
